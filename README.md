This is a code of ESFPA algorithm for feature selection problem

INSTRUCTIONS:                                                                                                                              路 Load the data
路 Sort the features according to their correlation values using sortFeatures.m
路 Select features using main.m including initialize pollen, update pollen positions, calculate fitness scores and output feature subset
路 Protein essentiality prediction is performed by using WEKA software package to create a new classifier and perform 10-fold cross validation to make an evaluation
